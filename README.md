## Hi, Iâ€™m Chris ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer with 10+ years of experience helping teams build beautiful, scalable, and intuitive productsâ€”from robust frontend platforms to internal tools that make engineering a breeze. I care deeply about developer experience, clean architecture, and bringing clarity to complex systems (with a little âœ¨ magic when I can).

Iâ€™ve also spent years in the theater world as a professional actor and founding Artistic Director of [The Nerve](https://nervetheatre.org), a gritty, immersive company in my hometown of Dayton, Ohio. Whether onstage or in code, I love telling stories, solving problems, and creating experiences that feel human, memorable, and meaningful.
